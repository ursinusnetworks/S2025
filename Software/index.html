										<h1>Software Environment</h1>
									</header>

									<p>
										Since this is a systems programming class that uses networks, we're going to need to setup some pretty complicated software to do the cool things we need to do on the assignments.  Students will follow three steps to get setup:
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											<a href = "#vscode">Setup the VSCode IDE</a> with all of the features we need for the course
										</li>
										<li>
											Setup development tools for C on either <a href = "#windows">Windows</a> or <a href = "#macos">Mac OS</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											Setup <a href = "#virtualbox">VirtualBox</a> to host a tool we'll use to create a software defined network on our own computer!
										</li>
									</ol>
									

									<h2><a name = "vscode">Step 1: Visual Studio Code</a></h2>
									<p>
										In this class, we will be using <b>Microsoft Visual Studio Code(VSCode)</b>  to write code.  VSCode has nice plugins for syntax highlighting, code completion, and built in documentation for C and C++.  Visit <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/download">this link</a> to download VSCode for your appropriate operating system.  Most Windows and Linux users will want the <b>64-bit</b> download.  Please post on Discord if you are having any issues installing VSCode.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Even if you already have VSCode installed, continue on to the instructions below to make sure you have the plugins configured properly for this class.</b>
									</p>

									<HR>
									<h3><a name = "remote">Setting Up SSH with VSCode</a></h3>

									

									<p>
										<b>Motivation:</b> Students will be using a tool called <a href = "http://mininet.org/">mininet</a> in some of the later assignments, which is used to simulate various network connections.  Unfortunately, it's a bit difficult to install natively on Mac or Windows, but I've created some virtual images that you can run using <a href = "https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.  Luckily, VSCode has a very nice add-on that makes it easy to connect and code on these virtual images.  You can read more information about it at <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh">this link</a>, but I will summarize the important information below
									</p>

									<h3><a name = "remotedevel">1: Install Remote Development Extension Pack</a></h3>

									<p>
										First, search for and install Microsoft's <code>Remote Development Extension Pack</code> in the extensions store:
									</p>

									<img src = "remoteDevel.png" width="40%">

									<p>
										We'll return to this in the <a href = "#virtualbox">virtualbox section</a>
									</p>


									<h3><a name = "intellisesecpp">2: Install And Configure Microsoft Intellisense C/C++ Extensions</a></h3>
									<p>
										First, install the plugin, then, click on the settings icon next to it and scroll down to "Settings"
									</p>
									<img src = "cppextension.png" width="40%">
									<p>
										And switch the standard to <code>gnu++17</code> and <code>gnu17</code>
									</p>
									<img src = "cppextensionversion.png" width="80%">

									

									<h3><a name = "terminal">3. VSCode Command Line</a></h3>
									<p>
										One nice thing about VSCode is that you can launch a terminal in the IDE below where you're coding.  There are myriad ways to launch the terminal, and it even has its own dedicated menu in VSCode.  Once you've logged in using the directions above, you can launch a terminal at the bottom of your code environment, and you should see something like this:
									</p>

									<img src = "terminal.png">

									<p>
										Note that you can open up multiple terminals, which will be useful in this class.
									</p>


									<HR>

									<h2><a name = "vscodefeatures">Other Features</a></h2>

									<p>
										Below are a few features I want to highlight that will come in handy as your working.
									</p>

									<h4><a name = "unused">Unused variable highlighting</a></h4>
									<p>
										If you don't use a variable, it will show up in darker text.  This is very useful when debugging.  It means that either you didn't actually need the variable, you forgot to use it (hence you didn't complete your code), or you spelled it wrong somewhere.  This saved many a student last year! (NOTE: The examples below are in Javascript, but the same applies to C/C++/assembly)
									</p>

									<img src = "HighlightingUnused.gif" width=800>

									<h4><a name = "replace">Replace within Selection</a></h4>
									<p>
										If you want to change the name of a variable in one section of your code, you can do a <code>CTRL+F</code>, which will bring up the find/replace menu, then follow these steps:
									</p>
									<img src = "ReplaceSelection.gif" width=800>

									<h4><a name = "docsmethod">Method Documentation</a></h4>

									<p>
										There's a nice feature where if you start typing <code>/**</code> and hit ENTER, it will autocomplete method documentation for you
									</p>

									<img src = "VSCodeDocs.gif">

										<h2><a name = "windows">Step 2a: Windows Software Environment Instructions</a></h2>

										<p>
											Below are instructions to setup a linux-like development environment on Windows
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "wslinstall"></a>Step 1: Install The <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a></h3>

										<ol>
											<li>
												<p>
												Open PowerShell as Administrator (Start menu > PowerShell > right-click > Run as Administrator)
												</p>
												
												<img src = "powershell.png">
												
												<p>
													and enter this command:
												</p>
												<p>

													<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
														wsl --install]]></script>  
												</p>
												<p>
													Then press <code>ENTER</code>
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Once the above has finished, restart your machine.  When it reboots, it should launch a terminal where you can configure your username and password:
												</p>
												<p>
													<img src = "wslrestart.png">
												</p>
											</li>
											
										</ol>
										
										<h3><a name = "windowsdev">Step 2: Configure Your Development Environment</a></h3>
										<p>
											Now that the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has finished installing, we'll test it out and setup the software needed for this class
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												<p>
													Launch WSL from the start menu
												</p>
												<img src = "wslrun.png">
												
											</li>
											<li>
												Back in the terminal, type
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade]]></script>  
												and hit <code>ENTER</code>
											</li>
											<li>
												<p>
													Next type
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													sudo apt install build-essential gcc g++ cmake valgrind lldb git openssh-server wireshark whois nmap tshark net-tools vim-nox python3 python3-pip firefox flex bison traceroute libnsl-dev mininet]]></script>  
												and hit <code>ENTER</code>.  This may take a moment.  When you see the following:
												</p>

												<p>
													<img src = "wireshark.png" width="60%">
												</p>
												<p>
													Be sure to select <code>Yes</code>
												</p>
											</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											Now you should have everything you need to compile C/C++ programs on your computer, as well as run a whole slew of network tools!
										</p>

										

										

										<h4><a name = "wslfilepaths">A Note on File Paths under WSL</a></h4>
										<p>
											It's possible to go through the entire class in just the terminal, but you may want to navigate through and organize your files and folders using the ordinary Windows explorer.  Everything under your regular windows filesystem is linked to from a special place in WSL.  For instance, if my username is <code>ctralie</code> and I have a folder named <code>CS174</code> on my Desktop, then I would change into the <code>CS174</code> directory by typing 
										</p>
										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
											cd /mnt/c/Users/ctralie/Desktop/CS174]]></script>
										<p></p>

										<p>
											Note also that if you have VSCode installed, you can open files anywhere under your WSL file tree in VSCode by typing
										</p>

										<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
											code filename</script>
										<p></p>

										<p>
											where <code>filename</code> is the name of the file you want to open
										</p>
										<p></p>

										<h4><a name = "copypaste">A Note on Copy/Pasting under WSL</a></h4>

											<p>
												Since <code>CTRL+C</code> means something special (kill a running process), copy actually happens with <code>CTRL+SHIFT+C</code>.  Likewise, paste happens with <code>CTRL+SHIFT+V</code>.
											</p>

										<h3><a name = "x11">Step 3: Setup VcXsrv Windows X11 Server</a></h3>
										<p>
											We need to setup an X11 <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">XWindows</a> client on Windows to receive messages from wireshark running in a virtual host for the more advanced assignments later in the course.  First, <a href = "https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">click here</a> to download VcXsrv.  Then, launch the program <code>XLaunch</code> with the default options:
										</p>

										<p>
											<img src = "vcxsrv1.png" width="40%">
										</p>

										<p>
											<img src = "vcxsrv2.png" width="40%">
										</p>

										<h3><a name = "putty">Step 4: Setup PuTTY</a></h3>
										<p>
											You'll need to download a special ssh terminal to use wireshark in the virtual image under Windows for more advanced assignments later in the course.  <a href = "https://www.putty.org/">Click here</a> to download PuTTY.  Then, configure PuTTY to connect to your localhost, which we'll use to run wireshark on the <a href = "#virtualbox">virtual image</a>.  First, select <code>127.0.0.1</code> as the host with port <code>3022</code>:
										</p>

										<img src = "puttyhost.png" width="40%">

										<p>
											Then, select <code>Enable X11 forwarding</code> after expanding the SSH node in the options tree:
										</p>

										<img src = "puttyx11.png" width="40%">
										<p>
											When you're finished this, you should go back and save your configuration so you don't have to re-enter this information each time.  You'll test to make sure this works after you setup the <a href = "#virtualbox">virtual image</a>
										</p>

										<HR>
										

										<p>
											Congratulations, you are now finished!  You may proceed to the <a href = "#virtualbox">virtualbox setup</a>
										</p>


										<HR>
										<h2><a name = "macos">Step 2b: Mac OS Software Environment Instructions</a></h2>

										<p>
											Mac OS comes with considerably more support by default for Linux-like apps than Windows does, but there's still some work we'll have to do to get it ready for this class.  Below are the steps:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Open up the terminal, and type 
												<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
													g++]]></script> 
												<p>
													and hit <code>ENTER</code>.  If it says <code>no input files found</code>, then that atually means g++ is working!  g++ is  a program that compiles c++ files, so it needs a file as input.  The fact that it tells you that means that it's running properly.  If, on the other hand, you get <code>Command 'g++' not found</code> or you get something about an "inactive developer path," then follow <a href = "https://flaviocopes.com/fix-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path/">these directions</a> before proceeding.  Be patient...they may take a moment.  You should see something like this happening
												</p>

									<HR>
										<h2><a name = "virtualbox">3. VirtualBox Setup</a></h2>

										<p>
											Later in the course when we implement parts of the transport layer (TCP) and the network layer (routing), we're going to use a program called <a href = "http://mininet.org/">mininet</a> to create software defined networks with arbitrary topologies on our own machines!  Because setting this up natively in Windows or Mac OS is quite complicated, I'm instead going to have students code on virtual linux images that I setup in the background.  This is the only time students will need to use the <a href = "#remote">remote login tools</a>; otherwise, they can code directly on their own filesystems.
										</p>

										<p>
											To get started, download and install VirtualBox at <a href = "https://www.virtualbox.org/">this link</a>, being sure to choose the right platform; for instance, those using M1/M2 macs should choose macOS/Apple Silicon hosts.  <b>Restart your computer after the installation</b>.
										</p>

										<p>
											Then, assuming you're on the Ursinus network, visit <a href = "http://nimbus.ursinus.edu/mininet/">http://nimbus.ursinus.edu/mininet/</a> and download and extract the .zip file appropriate for your system; those using M1/M2 macs should download the arm zip file, and those using Windows or intel macs should download the x86 zip file.  <b>You'll need about 10GB free on your machine to use these!</b>
										</p>

										<p>
											Once you've downloaded and extracted the file, open VirtualBox and add a new image, navigating to the folder where you extracted the virtual machine:
										</p>

										<img src = "virtualboxadd.png" width="70%">
										
										<p>
											Now, go to the <code>Network</code> properties of the virtual machine, and make sure the network adapter is attached to <code>NAT</code>:
										</p>
										<img src = "virtualbox_network1.png" width="60%">
										<p>
											Then, click on <code>Port Forwarding</code>, and setup an entry as follows (NOTE: This may already be setup, but double check it):
										</p>
										<img src = "virtualbox_network2.png" width="60%">
										<p>
											Finally, launch the VM and enter <code>mininet</code> for both the username and password.  Once it has booted up, we're going to log into it from VSCode's <a href = "#remotedevel">remote development extension</a>.  Type <code>CTRL+SHIFT+P</code>, and enter the following into 
										</p>

										<p>
											<code>
												ssh -p 3022 -X mininet@127.0.0.1
											</code>
										</p>

										<img src = "sshmininet.png" width="60%">

										<p>
											Save this information to your .ssh configuration for future use:
										</p>

										<img src = "sshsave.png" width="60%">

										<p>
											Now, you can enter the username and password, which are both <code><b>mininet</b></code>.  You can now code on this virtual image using the VSCode IDE!
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>NOTE:</b> If you want to make this more secure, you can change your password with the <code>passwd</code> command.  This might be good, since technically someone could ssh into that virtual machine while you were running it if they knew the port we were using (which would be as dangerous to you as someone breaking into a computer on your network).  Related to this, if you want to log in without having to present your password each time, follow the instructions at <a href = "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">this link</a>.
										</p>

										<h4>Running Wireshark on The Virtual Image</h4>
										<p>
											Now, if you're on Mac, you can launch wireshark by typing
										</p>
										<p>
											<code>sudo echo</code>
										</p>
										<p>
											and then
										</p>
										<p>
											<code>sudo HOME=~ wireshark &</code>
										</p>
										<p>
											(Note that the first command was just to make sure you'd entered your password for sudo mode before you launched a background process)
										</p>

										<p>
											If you're on Windows, you'll instead need to launch <a href = "#x11">XLaunch</a> and login using <a href = "#putty">PuTTY</a> and run those commands from the PuTTY shell.  But you can still run other non-GUI terminals through VSCode (I was just having trouble getting X11 forwarding working on windows in anything except PuTTY!)
										</p>
